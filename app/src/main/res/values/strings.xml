    <string name="tushy_text">Android is a mobile operating system (OS) developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It has been the best-selling OS on tablets and on smartphones since 2013, and has the largest installed base.[14][15] Android\'s user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard for text input. The operating system\'s current design language is Google\'s Material Design. Android\'s primary app store is Google Play, with over one million Android applications (\"apps\") published and 50 billion downloads as of July 2013.[16] In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed Android for television, cars, and wristwatches, each with a specialized yet similar interface. Variants and forked versions of Android are also used on notebooks, game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics.</string>
